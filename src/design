Confidentiality:

In our project, blind technique is used to protect the confidentiality. 
•	The voter uses AES to encrypt the vote. The key size is 256 bits.
•	Blind the encrypted votes.
•	Send (blind, sig, username) to admin.
•	Admin verifies the signature, and sends (blind, admin_sig) back to voter.
•	Voter checks the admin’s signature, and send encrypted vote and admin’s signature to the counter
•	The counter generates a random 20-byte nonce to the vote and update (nonce, encVote, signedVote) to database electionname
•	The voter checks the database and verifies the signature. If it is good, the voter sends the nonce, encrypted vote and the AES key to the server counter2.
•	The counter2 then decrypts the vote and update to the database.
•	The vote server counts the number of votes. 


Integrity:



Audit:

1.	Time: The time that an operation is being performing.

2.	Event Type: The types of different operations
➢	Login: The voter logs into the system
➢	Vote: The voter makes his/her vote
➢	Election Creation: The administrator creates elections for the voting
➢	Voter Send Info: The voter sends information to the server
➢	Counter Receive Info: The administrator receives data from the voter
➢	Counter Receive Info: The counter server receives data from the voter
➢	Admin Send Info: The administrator sends information to the voter

3.	Description: Detail about each operation.
